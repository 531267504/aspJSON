###How to use:

<!-- languages: vbscript, vb -->

    ' instantiate the class
	Dim oJSON = New JSON
	
	' add properties
	oJSON.Add "prop1", "someString"
	oJSON.Add "prop2", 12.3
	oJSON.Add "prop3", Array(1, 2, "three")
	
	' change some values
	oJSON.Change "prop1", "someOtherString"
	oJSON.Change "prop4", "thisWillBeCreated" ' this property doen't exists and will be created automagically
	
	' get the values
	Response.Write oJSON.Value("prop1") & "<br>"
	Response.Write oJSON.Value("prop2") & "<br>"
	Response.Write oJSON("prop3") & "<br>" ' default function is equivalent to `.Value(propName)`
	Response.Write oJSON("prop4") & "<br>"
	
	' get the JSON formatted output
	Dim jsonSting
	jsonString = oJSON.Serialize() ' this will contain the string representation of the JSON object
	
	oJSON.Write() ' this will write the output to the Response - equivalent to: Response.Write oJSON.Serialize()
	
	' load and parse some JSON formatted string
	jsonString = "{ ""strings"" : ""valorTexto"", ""numbers"": 123.456, ""arrays"": [1, ""2"", 3.4, [5, 6, [7, 8]]], ""objects"": { ""prop1"": ""outroTexto"", ""prop2"": [ { ""id"": 1, ""name"": ""item1"" }, { ""id"": 2, ""name"": ""item2"", ""teste"": { ""maisum"": [1, 2, 3] } } ] } }" ' double double quotes here because of the VBScript quotes scaping
	
	oJSON.Parse(jsonString) ' set this to a variable if your string to load can be an Array, since the function returns the parsed object and arrays are parsed to JSONarray objects
	' if the string represents an object, the current object is returned so there is no need to set the return to a new variable
	
	oJSON.Write()
	
	
To load records from a database:
	
	' load records from an ADODB.Recordset
	dim cn, rs
	set cn = CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
	cn.Open "yourConnectionStringGoesHere"
	
	set rs = cn.execute("SELECT id, nome, valor FROM pedidos ORDER BY id ASC")
	' this could also be:
	' set rs = CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset")
	' rs.Open "SELECT id, nome, valor FROM pedidos ORDER BY id ASC", cn	
	
	oJSON.LoadRecordset rs
	oJSONarray.LoadRecordset rs
	
	rs.Close
	cn.Close
	set rs = Nothing
	set cn = Nothing
	
	oJSON.Write() 		' outputs: {"data":[{"id":1,"nome":"nome 1","valor":10.99},{"id":2,"nome":"nome 2","valor":19.1}]}
	oJSONarray.Write() 	' outputs: [{"id":1,"nome":"nome 1","valor":10.99},{"id":2,"nome":"nome 2","valor":19.1}]
	
	
If you want to use arrays, I have something for you too

    ' instantiate the class
	Dim oJSONarray = New JSONarray
	
	' add something to the array
	oJSONarray.Push oJSON 	' Can be JSON objects, and even JSON arrays
	oJSONarray.Push 1.25 	' Can be numbers
	oJSONarray.Push "and strings too"
	
	' write to page
	oJSONarray.Write() ' Gess what? This does the same as the Write method from JSON object
